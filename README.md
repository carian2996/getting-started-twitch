_Using the official Twitch API, we analyze how to start using the platform and not die trying_


## 1. Context
**During the 2020 quarantine I discovered the amazing world of Twitch**. Creators, artists, gamers and more all together to share with us the best of their work, abilities and sometimes nothing more than a good coffee talk.

As a 1992-born boomer I felt content, platform and communities so "aggressive". Not in wrong way, don't misunderstand me. If you come from the old and boring world of Facebook, YouTube or other platforms take a quick look in the main page of [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/).  

After letting Twitch know your interests and what _[categories](https://www.twitch.tv/directory)_ you want to follow you will receive your first channel recommendations and then be "attacked" with visual content, non-stopping chats from a community built upon previous streams with their own slang, emotes and live interactions between the streamer and viewers. **I felt lost in repeated occasions and I just returned to the old silly FB videos.**

After some tries, I learned how environments and communities work. I subscribed a couple of channels, won channel points to troll sometimes to [TSG](https://www.twitch.tv/thestockguy), amazed with the [NICKMERCS](https://www.twitch.tv/nickmercs)'s COD Warzone Tournament or simply watching how [Alex](https://www.twitch.tv/alex_zedra) smashed the field. **But I have to say it, the learning curve to start using Twitch was very steep**.

## 2. The Problem
At the beginning I was so confused on how to use the Twitch platform, generate my own channel recommendations and start to interact more and more with content creators. I'll assume that many people will encounter the same problem as I do. 

So I was wondering **how can I use all data generated by Twitch creators to start using the platform more and more**. With this, even more questions arose:

1. What type of data can I get from Twitch?
2. How can I retrieve all this information?
3. Who are the Twitch creators?
4. What actions define the engagement in the Twitch platform?
5. What insights can I generate to help new users to facilitate their journey to this magical world? 

## 3. Solution
I'll be working on this for the following weeks :)
